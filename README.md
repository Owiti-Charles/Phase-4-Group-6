## Introduction

In the current technology driven society, social media often acts as a platform where people share their thoughts, feelings, and opinions. Through the use of machine learning and natural language processing, we can collect peoples' sentiments  and analyze it.

In this notebook, I will be building a model that will attempt to predict the sentiment of the tweet. The tweets have already been labeled as having "positive emotion", "negative emotion", or "no emotion towards a brand or product".

## Business Understanding

Humans struggle with assigning sentiment to text, especially with more casual language such as what is used on Twitter. The researchers found that it is very rare for people to completely agree on the sentiment of a tweet, therefore, sentiment can be very hard to assign, but can be helpful to companies for gauging their consumers' reactions to new products.

With an NLP model that can predict sentiment, we hope to identify positive, negative or neutral tweets so that we might better understand why those users don't have a positive opinion of the brand or product.  That can inform a company like Apple or Google with information as to how they should allocate resources to marketing and advertising.  We could use the NLP model to predict sentiment, then use some sort of clustering algorithm for market segmentation so we can understand what business decisions we should make next.
